        <p>Batman, also known as the Dark Knight, is one of the most iconic superheroes in the world. Created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger, he made his first appearance in Detective Comics #27 in 1939. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess superpowers. Instead, he relies on his intelligence, detective skills, and advanced technology to fight crime in Gotham City.</p>
        <p>With a tragic past that fuels his mission, Bruce Wayne dons the cape and cowl to protect his city from villains such as the Joker, Two-Face, and the Riddler. His unwavering commitment to justice and his strict moral code make him one of the most respected and feared heroes of all time.</p>
