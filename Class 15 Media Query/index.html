        <!-----------Media Query---------------->
        <!--Media query mens making the website responsive. Responsive means adjusting the website according to the screen szie. if screen is big then website should becomes, if screen is small the website should become small.
        but this does not happen automatically 
        one way is we create three different websites for three main screens : laptop, tablet, phone
        this is time taking
        Second way is we use media query : in this we do html coding once , but we do CSS coding three times one for laptop, one for tablet, one for phone.
